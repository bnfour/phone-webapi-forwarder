# UNSUPPORTED APP

No longer actively maintained. Originally written for 4.4, no idea about compatibility with newer versions.  
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK  


This is an Android client for my so-called [web API that relays messages to Telegram](https://github.com/bnfour/dotnet-telegram-forwarder).  
It is capable of forwarding incoming SMS messages and data about missed calls. Heavily based on my previous Android app, [SMS Forwarder](https://github.com/bnfour/smsforwarder).  
It has filter by sender which is shared both by SMS and calls forwarders.  
In order to use this, you'll need to get server part running first.  
The code is very far from ideal, but whatever.
